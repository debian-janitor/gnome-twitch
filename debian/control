Description: GNOME Twitch app for watching Twitch.tv streams without a browser or flash
 gnome-twitch provides a GTK3 interface for viewing streams on Twitch.
 At the moment you can 
  * browse popular streams,
  * browse streams by game,
  * search for streams,
  * view streams,
  * use the chat with a Twitch account,
  * change the video quality,
  * mark streams as favorites for faster access.
 More features like recording streams, VODs (Video-On-Demand), 
 other player backends and integration of Twitch account features 
 like following streams are planned.
